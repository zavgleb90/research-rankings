    <h1>Methodology</h1>

    <!-- 🔽 Paste your text here as HTML 🔽 -->

    <p><strong>Date:</strong> 28 November 2025</p>

    <p>This document briefly describes the methodology used to compile data and records used to display information shown on the website based on prior published and ongoing work (Mithas & Silveira, 2024; Mithas et al., 2025; Zavadskiy et al., 2025). </p>

    <p>We focus here on 51 journals that appear in the UTD-24 or FT-50 list. Table 1 shows 51 journals mapped to disciplines. Table 2 shows full names of abbreviated discipline names in Table 1.</p>

    <p>We use the Web of Science (WOS) database as a starting point, and made a few analytic choices as well as some manual cleaning of data for authors and institutions. We only consider the papers with six authors or less, resulting in dropping less than 0.5% of the total sample.</p>

    <p>Since WOS database considers a broad range of publications including editorial material, letters, corrections, among others, we restricted our analyses to three types of publications:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Article</li>
      <li>Article; Proceedings paper</li>
      <li>Review</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For our institutional analyses, we focus on universities (not business schools as UTD list does), and we do not consider government agencies, research centers, private companies, among other institutions, such as:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>National Bureau of Economic Research</li>
      <li>Federal Reserve Bank</li>
      <li>Centre for Economic Policy Research (UK)</li>
      <li>Center for Economic &amp; Policy Research (CEPR)</li>
      <li>UDICE–French Research Universities</li>
      <li>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We used our discretion to remove duplicated entries based on best judgment. For example, “Arizona State University” and “Arizona State University–Tempe” appeared separately but refer to the same institution. We also disregarded system-level entries such as “Florida State University System.”</p>

    <p>Rankings are generated overall and for each disciplinary area. Discipline-specific rankings classify journals into their primary domains (Table 1), acknowledging that some journals may publish interdisciplinary work.</p>

    <p>Our institutional rankings differ from UTD because our methodology differs. However, correlation between our ranking and UTD’s ranking for the period 2017–2021 exceeds 0.95.</p>
